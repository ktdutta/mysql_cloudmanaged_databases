## MySQL Setup on Azure and GCP

### GCP 

I started off with creating an instance of mySQL on GCP. These were the settings I set up in order to make this instance cost-effective for this assignment as well as meet the requirements for the assignment. 

In order to make sure that the instance is configured to allow inbound traffic from different servers I configured the network to be 0.0.0.0/0.

### Azure 

I next created my instance on Azure and below is a screenshot of my settings.

## MySQL Workbench for Database Interaction

For both Azure and GCP a seperate connection was made and connected to MySQL Workbench where I created and used the same Entity-Relationship Diagram in each seperate connection. Below are the steps taken to create the ERD.
